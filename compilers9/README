Assignment 9

I implemented up to the Interpreter. If you look in my parser you'll see functions for the procedure declaration, the actuals, setting up the symbol table to accomodate procedures, the call function, the call function returning a ProcedureNode. If you look in interpreter you'll find a part for ProcedureNode. In the CodeGenerator there is a part for ProcedureNode but I couldn't figure out the assembly.

These assignments since the ast have been difficult for me for some reason and I really tried but its been impossible to catch up. sorry for so many missing parts in assignments.
