Assignment 2

The next function will return the next available token until the eof token.
The eof token will be printed out as well. 

Usage:

./sc -s filename.txt

filename.txt is expected to have simple code. if illegal characters are found
an error message will be produced highlighting the illegal character.

This was written in Python 2.7. I wrote a shebang statement in sc specifying
the version so please run it with python 2.7.

Additional Comments:

I made a map of the keywords and symbols from the lists only so that when 
I check if a token is a keyword or symbol I would have constant access time 
checking vs linear checking if I were to search through the keyword list. 
The 2.7 docs show that using the in keyword with a dictionary automatically
hashes the value.

When entering input from stdin (not specifying filename), you need to hit 
enter, and then the eof signal (ctrl+d) for the program to generate a token
list.

When an error within the token parsing class occurs (unclosed comment or 
illegal character), the code prints out the partial list of tokens up to
the position at which the error occurred, the error message, and then exits 
the program. It does not continue parsing. The eof token is only printed if 
no error occurs. All errors except those in sc give the position at which the 
error occurred.

For comments, if a comment is not closed, an error will be printed and the
program will stop parsing. The position given is the position of the most
recently opened comment that has not been closed

The tokens are printed in the all() function but a token_list is also returned.
I may change the fact that they are printed in this location for the next assignment.
