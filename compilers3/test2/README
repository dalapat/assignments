Notes:

If an error occurs either in the scanner or parser, the error will output and the 
program will stop

All informational statements go to stdout and and all errors go to stderr

I changed my Token to have a kind map so that each relevant operator or keyword
has its own kind. 

I know that Observer has more functions than necessary and that this is a design flaw.
In the future I will most likely just make a function to print the token, a token
to print the begin nonterminal, and an end function.
