Assignment 8
Compilers and Interpreters

I fixed a lot of my issues with my code generator. Aside from field nodes and a a small bug with if nodes the code generator much better than before now. I attempted to optimize the code generator by following option b but I realized that without getting my code generator in a better functioning state I would not be able to proceed with the assignment.
